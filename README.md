## Rolling Dice

The DM of the Swinburne Caves & Lizards Club has decided that they would like to digitise the dice-rolling that their adventures require.  They are looking for a developer and as part of their selection/tendering process are running a coding challenge.  The requirements for the challenge follow:

Write a program that simulates rolling dice.

When the program runs, it will:

1. Ask the user how many times they would like to roll the dice

2. Randomly choose a number between 1 and 6, for the number of dice that the user has indicated.  The number rolled will be printed.

3. Ask the user if theyâ€™d like to roll again.  If yes, go to step one.  Otherwise, exit.
